This is a challenge to iFood. The objective was development a solution to solve problem (diagram below) between frontend and microservice. I decided to develop a backend for conversation between frontend and microservice and implemented some concepts by DDD (Domain Drive Design) adapting the problem.
In **Backend** i separeted in Modules and when necessary joined Clients and Orders for a better return. In **Frontend** i used concepts like Mobile First and separeted into three components. The first Component is Search Form with all inputs, the second component is Input with all logic isolated like validation and specific styles and the last component is Search Resul where is all logic of the result list and Modal with details by order. And finally, i change **Microservice** putting filter by Name, Email and Phone in only method, and created other methods necessary for better solution. More details in codes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install and how to install them. Check if exists **Yarn**, **NPM**, **Java 8** and **Maven** in your machine for install dependencies and build the **microservice**, **backend** and **frontend**.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development running. 
**Is more important follow this step by step. Make sure everything is working normally.**

### Microservices

To install and run the micro-services, use maven commands mvn package and mvn spring-boot:run on both folders. The Client will run on port 8081 and the Order on 8082.

```
mvn package
